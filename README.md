## Introduction

Outside of the so-called [Application Layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_layer), so much of the way computers and servers now work has been moved away from in-house teams and specialists and onto "the cloud" that terms like [DevOps](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/3rpzem/devops_vs_sysadmin/cwqmlnd/) have become standard among recruiters, companies, and developers themselves. In other words, modern web development concepts revolve entirely around things like automation, APIs, cloud services, and so forth -- a phenomemon we might refer to as Web 3.0.

While this shift is exciting, there is now a massive and evergrowing disconnect between emerging technologies and services and typical small and medium sized businesses (SMBs) and independent teams who face an impossible learning curve to maintain not only a competitive edge, but to even keep up with basic standards in security, etc.

Typical SMB owner thought process:

* Why is my website loading so slowly?
* Which web hosting company should I choose?
* What cache/security plugin is the best?
* When is my freelancer going to reply?
* @#$%! THIS... BACK TO SHOPIFY!

TL;DR: while "the wheel" might not need re-inventing, it surely [can be improved](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/greener-tires/).

That is, while Silicon Valley bigwigs and corporate players pump out new terms and services on a daily basis -- like Configuration Management (CM) -- the typical small business website is still trying to figure out how to make their contact forms work correctly. The "old guard" shared web hosting monopoly -- think EIG/GoDaddy -- also has little motivation to education their audience, as perpetuating confusion seems to be a core pillar of their business model.

Before the likes of Google and Amazon and Shopify and Wix take over the entire web and turn it into Wall Street-backed website builders that feed into their private ecosystems, SlickStack hopes to bridge the knowledge gap between emerging technology and old-school web development to empower SMBs to achieve top notch website performance and security by offering a "controlled" LEMP-stack environment with limited options that is perfectly suited to the world's most popular open-source CMS: WordPress.

## The Basics

Much of modern computing history can be traced back to one thing: [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix). Indeed, one of the only things about web servers tbat hasn't changed in several decades is the shell (bash) language. Keeping long-term support and simplicity in mind, SlickStack is coded entirely in bash scripts.
