## Introduction

Outside of the so-called [Application Layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_layer), so much of the way computers and servers work has now been moved away from in-house teams and specialists and onto "the cloud" that terms like DevOps have become standard terms among recruiters, companies, and developers themselves. In other words, concepts of the day now revolve entirely around things like automation, APIs, cloud services, and so forth -- a phenomemon we can refer to as Web 3.0.
