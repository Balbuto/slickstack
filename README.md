## Introduction

Outside of the so-called [Application Layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_layer), so much of the way computers and servers now work has been moved away from in-house teams and specialists and onto "the cloud" that terms like [DevOps](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/3rpzem/devops_vs_sysadmin/cwqmlnd/) have become standard among recruiters, companies, and developers themselves. In other words, modern webdev concepts revolve entirely around things like automation, APIs, cloud services, and so forth -- a phenomemon we might refer to as Web 3.0.

While this is surely quite exciting, there is now a massive disconnect between emerging technologies and services and typical small and medium sized businesses (SMBs) and independent teams who face an impossible learning curve to maintain not only a competitive edge, but to even keep up with basic standards in security, etc.

The idea behind SlickStack is that while "the wheel" might not need re-inventing, it surely [can be improved](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/greener-tires/). While Silicon Valley bigwigs and corporate players pump out new terms and services on a daily basis -- like Configuration Management (CM) -- the typical small business website is still trying to figure out how to make their contact forms work correctly.

## The Basics

Much of modern computing history can be traced back to one thing: [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix).
