<div class="notice notice-warning">
<p><strong>Notice:</strong> Clearing caches can now be done using the <strong>Clear Caches</strong> drop-down menu in the top-right of the WP Admin Toolbar above. You can either clear "all caches" or clear them one-by-one (for geeky developers). In most cases, clearing only the Nginx (server/page) cache should be sufficient, such as when you are updating your frontend web design and want your changes to appear immediately. If this confuses you, don't worry, because the various caches clear themselves automatically after a while anyway. In certain cases, you might also need to clear the CloudFlare CDN cache as well to "purge" the old files (e.g. images, CSS, and JS files) using the <strong>CloudFlare</strong> drop-down menu. If you want to temporarily disable the CloudFlare cache for 3 hours, you can also enable "Dev" mode instead (not needed in most cases).</p>
<p>We hope you are enjoying our recent backend improvements! Please contact us with any questions or feedback.</p>
<p><em>This message will disappear automatically after a few days, thank you.</em></p>
